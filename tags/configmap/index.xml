&lt;p>A Pod is collection of containers running in shared namespace. A container is created from Docker/OCI Image, which is immutable in nature i.e. data bundled into the image cannot be changed later in image.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;While immutable image of application is great for security, but putting configurations &amp;amp; data like security keys is bad for security as well as portability&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are various ways to pass data to application in containers, without changing the flow of application e.g. by setting environment variables or using volume mount to provide configuration file at the time of container creation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
